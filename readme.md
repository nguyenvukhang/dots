# dots

hello from a mac.  
welcome to my dotfile repo.  
mac's mostly gui so this isn't gonna exactly be a roller coaster ride.

### general setup

clone the repo, then recursively update submodules with the
`submodule-init` script.

stow files using the `setup` script.

build the lua language server with the `lua-build` script.
